For quite some while, actually the very beginning of playing fingerstyle (or kinda) I've heard an
impressive song. It's an catchy tune with an easy but at the same time unique melody.
I think there is for all of us only a few songs which we like to listen to even after years. For me "Windy and Warm" is definitely
one of those. There are lots of interpretations of it out there. The first time I've heard the song was at a Tommy Emmanuel
show. I was wondering who the composer of the song would be. On YouTube I've stumbled across a video where John D. Loudermilk talks about
the story how "Windy and Warm" arose. Chet Atkins was asking if he could write a song for him, since he's gotten too deepely
into Jazz and he wanted to get back to his roots (which was Blues). John D. Loudermilk approved. The day when Loudermilk wanted to present a first
version of "Windy and Warm", Chet had already finished the song before Loudermilk could so.
For Loudermilk the reason why Chet was able to predict how the song will go further was that he had a good understanding
of motives (musical fragments) in several music genres. When Loudermilk talked about the story you can hear the proudness of him
that he wrote one of Chet's main songs. Loudermilk never recorded the song on its own. He passed away on September 21, 2016 and got 82 years old.


Hope you'll enjoy this small excerpt. Recorded with a high quality microphone of an 120$ mobile phone.
