There is not much in life which is certain in terms of what your senses are telling you. You think it's the truth, but it's your truth. Trying to be always truly I always liked if my environment was behaving the same. Speaking of truth means also not to utilize the nescience of someone. That applys surely to lot's of parts in life. For instance, I always liked when someone was playing an acoustic instrument without any effects or something, just in front of the audience - alone. That requires skill and courage. When listening to music I mostly pick live-recordings or even better trial recordings. The lyrics, melodies, recording-techniques of beatles-records for instance are just perfect. But if you listen to trial recordings, you'll see how brillant they were in reallity. 

Appreciating the truth of trial recordings I'll put in the category "Songbook" some of my self composed songs. Beside the fact that I like trial recordings I'm also not the best in recording songs. Maybe all the stuff can be recorded professionally some day. Until then you'll have to listen to my mobile phone recordings. They could be worse. In the end the most important thing is to get access to the melody.

Some parts might be not to 100 percent correct played and the recording has some broken parts.
I used a looping station to program the percussions and to record the riff.
Hope you'll enjoy.
